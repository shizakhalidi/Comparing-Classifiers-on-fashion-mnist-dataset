# Comparing-Classifiers-on-fashion-mnist-dataset
Given a Fashion-MNIST dataset comprising of 28x28 grayscale images of 60,000 fashion products
from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images and the test set
has 10,000 images.

Building a scikit-learn based classifier for this dataset to classify each input image into one (out
of 10) categories. You are required to experiment with three to four different classifiers and report
accuracy of each of them.
